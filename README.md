This material outlines a hands-on workshop on learning how to develop AI-based autonomous mobile robot for university students and engineers of all skill levels. MATLAB and Simulink are utilized as an intuitive learning environment for deep learning and control algorithms with a 3D virtual simulation environment. In addtion, this content also covers the hardware deployment using an [NVIDIA&reg; JetBot](https://jetbot.org/).
